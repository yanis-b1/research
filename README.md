# Independent Research — A Kelly-Based Framework for Risk-Controlled V-Cycle Iterations in Megaprojects

This repository contains an independent research manuscript written in LaTeX.

## Overview
The document explores state-dependent outcomes in iterative decision processes, 
emphasizing how identical actions may yield different results depending on timing, 
context, and stochastic realizations.
